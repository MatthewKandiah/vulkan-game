# vulkan-game
Just curious how hard Vulkan is to get up and running compared to OpenGL --- We've got the answer, it's a lot more effort!
Following the [Khronos Vulkan tutorial](https://docs.vulkan.org/tutorial/latest/00_Introduction.html), but using Zig instead of C++ because we're here for a good time.

## TODO
- Continue from [Image view and sampler](https://docs.vulkan.org/tutorial/latest/06_Texture_mapping/01_Image_view_and_sampler.html)
