# vulkan-game
Just curious how hard Vulkan is to get up and running compared to OpenGL.
Following the [Khronos Vulkan tutorial](https://docs.vulkan.org/tutorial/latest/00_Introduction.html), but using Zig instead of C++ because we're here for a good time.

## TODO
Continue from [Framebuffers](https://docs.vulkan.org/tutorial/latest/03_Drawing_a_triangle/03_Drawing/00_Framebuffers.html)
