# vulkan-game
Just curious how hard Vulkan is to get up and running compared to OpenGL.
Following the [Khronos Vulkan tutorial](https://docs.vulkan.org/tutorial/latest/00_Introduction.html), but using Zig instead of C++ because we're here for a good time.

## TODO
Continue from [Retrieving the swap chain images](https://docs.vulkan.org/tutorial/latest/03_Drawing_a_triangle/01_Presentation/01_Swap_chain.html#_retrieving_the_swap_chain_images)
